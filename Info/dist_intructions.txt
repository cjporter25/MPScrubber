********STEP ONE********
****INSTALLS & REQUIREMENTS****
- Ensure "setuptools" & "wheel" have been installed
    - "pip install setuptools"
    - "pip install wheel"
- Ensure "build" & "installer" have been installed
    - "pip install build"
    - "pip install installer"
- Create requirements.txt file
    - "venv\Scripts\pip freeze > requirements.txt"
    - "pip freeze > requirements.txt"

****SETUP.PY****
- Create a setup.py file in the main directory
- Fill it will these items:
    setup(
        name='mpscrubber',
        version='0.1',
        packages=find_packages(include=['Marketplace', 'Marketplace.*']),
        install_requires=[
            'typing_extensions==4.9.0',
            'urllib3==2.1.0',
            'webdriver-manager==4.0.1',
            # add other required packages here (in requirements.txt)
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'mpscrubber=main:main',
        ],
    },
)
- NOTE: 
    - The version can dynamically changed with each new version
    - The packages list will include any folders deemed necessary in the future.
    - The install requires list is simple a list of everything in the requirements.txt
      file after it's been updated.
    - The entry points list is simply wherever the main python script lives

********STEP TWO********
****BUILD THE PACKAGE****
- "python -m build"
- NOTE: This creates a dist folder containing the the .tar and .whl dsitribution
  packages.
- NOTE: This also creates a [project_name].egg-info folder containing metadata
  about packages like dependencies and other package details. This is created
  by the "setuptools" module installed earlier.

****COPY OVER EVERYTHING****
mkdir dist_package
cp -r dist dist_package/
cp requirements.txt dist_package/
cp main.py dist_package/
cp -r Marketplace dist_package/

****CREATE INSTALLATION SCRIPTS****
- Add README.md, install.sh, install.bat to the dist_package folder
**README**
    # MPSCRUBBER
    ## Installation
    ### Using install.sh (Unix-based systems)
    ```sh
    ./install.sh
**install.sh**
    ### install.sh

    # This is a shell script for setting up the project on Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS).
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment
    . venv/bin/activate
    # Install the required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    echo "Installation complete. To run the application, 
    ctivate the virtual environment and run 'python main.py'."
**install.bat**
    @echo off
    :: Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    :: Activate the virtual environment
    call venv\Scripts\activate
    :: Install the required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    echo Installation complete. To run the application, activate the virtual environment and run 'python main.py'.
    pause

********STEP THREE********
****ZIP IT UP****
- Navigate to the MPSCRUBBER directory
    - cd path\to\MPSCRUBBER
- Zip the dist_package directory
    - Compress-Archive -Path .\dist_package -DestinationPath .\mpscrubber_test_build.zip
- NOTE: This can also be done in file explorer by right clicking and telling it to
  zip the folder.
