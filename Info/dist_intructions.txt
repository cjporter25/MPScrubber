********STEP ONE********
****INSTALLS & REQUIREMENTS****
- Ensure "setuptools" & "wheel" has been installed
    - "pip install setuptools"
    - "pip install wheel"
- Create requirements.txt file
    - "venv\Scripts\pip freeze > requirements.txt"
    - "pip freeze > requirements.txt"

****SETUP.PY****
- Create a setup.py file in the main directory
- Fill it will these items:
    setup(
        name='mpscrubber',
        version='0.1',
        packages=find_packages(include=['Marketplace', 'Marketplace.*']),
        install_requires=[
            'typing_extensions==4.9.0',
            'urllib3==2.1.0',
            'webdriver-manager==4.0.1',
            # add other required packages here (in requirements.txt)
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'mpscrubber=main:main',
        ],
    },
)
- NOTE: 
    - The version can dynamically changed with each new version
    - The packages list will include any folders deemed necessary in the future.
    - The install requires list is simple a list of everything in the requirements.txt
      file after it's been updated.
    - The entry points list is simply wherever the main python script lives
