***COMMUNICATION LOG***
    - (11.9.23 - Phone Call) Client spoke with me over the phone on Nov. 9th inquiring about an application that could
      automatically notify them about used vehicles within a specific radius around their home.
        - This conversation provided basic project parameters, i.e., which online marketplaces
          they'd like to be following, as well as what vehicle parameters they're looking for.
        - These parameters are specified below =>
            - Auto Manufacturer Preference:
                - Lexus, Toyota, Honda
            - Price Range:
                - $0 - $20,000
            - Year Range:
                - 2000 or newer
            - Location:
                - South of downtown St.Paul. Within a 25 Mile radius
            

***PROJECT FOCUS***
    - Initial Full Scope and Summary:
        - This project will function as a web scrubber for the following marketplaces:
            - Facebook marketplace
            - Craigslist
        - This project will need to make requests using pre-determiend parameters to 
          these online marketplaces, pull in the results, and store the relevant information
        - The client would then like some form of notification that highlights items that
          best fit their current preferences so they can act upon showings much sooner than
          others would normally.
