***SETUP***
    - Created a main folder called "MPScrubber"
    - Added a base python file called "app.py"
    - Added this text file to notate active steps taken during development
    - Initialized a virtual environment where all project libraries, necessary
      for it to function, will be installed.
        - ACTIVATION: .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

***FIRST STEPS***
    - To create a more realistic initial testing environment, this project will 
      focus on Facebook Marketplace as its URL schema seems to be much cleaner than
      Craigslist
    - Before this, I need to learn how to conduct basic web scrapping
    - ***NECESSARY IMPORTS***
        - "requests"
            - This module allows python to make a request on the web given a valid URL
            - "pip install requests"
        - "beautifulSoup"
            - This module allows python to cleanly read-in raw HTML that can then be
              sifted through.
            - "pip install beautifulsoup4"
    - ***KEEPING TRACK OF IMPORTS***
        - pip freeze
            - This command collects all currently installed libraries. This collection can
              then be output to some file. In this case, the file is called "requirements.txt"
            - "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
