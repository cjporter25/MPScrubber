***Create a connection to a marketplace***
    - FIRST: Learn the in's and out's of Python's various scrapping libraries and methods.
        - (11.26.23): BeautifulSoup4 is a python library for pulling data out of HTML and 
          XML files. Useful elements of this Python Library can be found in the "BeautifulSoup"
          section of the development log.


***Decipher the trailing "exact=true or exact=false"***
    - At first, it isn't clear what exactly it's for.
    - Testing (11.20.23): Used the parameters of $0 to $20000 for Toyota vehicles and
      manually changed the parameter in the URL to both true and false.
        - The resulting output didn't vary at all between the two. For now, it will
          largely be ignored unless necessary in the future.

***Filter Constants aren't all showing up correctly***
    - (11.26.23): The SORTING_FILTERS isn't able to recognize the input "key" when
      running the first test run. Unsure at this time why it can't,
      (UPDATE): Just kidding, the "F" shouldn't be capitalized in "First". Changing
      the sorting filter so it is capitalized
