********STEP ONE********
****INSTALLS & REQUIREMENTS****
- Ensure "setuptools" & "wheel" have been installed
    - "pip install setuptools"
    - "pip install wheel"
- Ensure "build" & "installer" have been installed
    - "pip install build"
    - "pip install installer"
- Create requirements.txt file
    - "venv\Scripts\pip freeze > requirements.txt"
    - "pip freeze > requirements.txt"

****SETUP.PY****
- Create a setup.py file in the main directory
- Fill it will these items:
    setup(
        name='mpscrubber',
        version='0.1',
        packages=find_packages(include=['Marketplace', 'Marketplace.*']),
        install_requires=[
            'typing_extensions==4.9.0',
            'urllib3==2.1.0',
            'webdriver-manager==4.0.1',
            # add other required packages here (in requirements.txt)
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'mpscrubber=main:main',
        ],
    },
)
- NOTE: 
    - The version can dynamically changed with each new version
    - The packages list will include any folders deemed necessary in the future.
    - The install requires list is simple a list of everything in the requirements.txt
      file after it's been updated.
    - The entry points list is simply wherever the main python script lives

********STEP TWO********
****BUILD THE PACKAGE****
- "python -m build"
- NOTE: This creates a "dist" folder containing the the .tar and .whl dsitribution
  packages.
- NOTE: This also creates a [project_name].egg-info folder containing metadata
  about packages like dependencies and other package details. This is created
  by the "setuptools" module installed earlier.

****COPY OVER EVERYTHING****               
1. cp -r dist/* dist_package/dist
2. cp main.py dist_package/
3. robocopy marketplaceFB dist_package\marketplaceFB /MIR /XD __pycache__
4. cp README.md dist_package/README.md 

****CREATE INSTALLATION SCRIPTS****
- Add README.md, install.sh, install.bat to the dist_package folder

********STEP THREE********
****ZIP IT UP****
- Navigate to the MPSCRUBBER directory
    - cd path\to\MPSCRUBBER
- Zip the dist_package directory
    - Compress-Archive -Path .\dist_package -DestinationPath test_builds\mpscrubber_test_build_[v_#_#].zip
- To FORCE an overwrite of what was there, use this:
    - Compress-Archive -Path .\dist_package -DestinationPath test_builds\mpscrubber_test_build_[v_#_#].zip -Force
    - NOTE: [Simply renaming the zip file would also work]
- NOTE: This can also be done in file explorer by right clicking and telling it to
  zip the folder.

*****USERS COMPUTER*****
- Install Python, add PYTHON to PATH, (if not done automatically)
- Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser (to run scripts)
